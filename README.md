# PowerBI-Golf-Cart-Data

## These are PowerBI reports that use data used in my PowerApps app used by leaders at The Walt Disney Company to check out a golf cart. It is meant to be a proof-of-concept that was not used by the company in any way, shape or form.

## The first PowerBi report shows, in descending order, the leaders who have used the golf cart the most. The names were redacted to ensure the leader's privacy.

## The second PowerBI report shows how many people have checked out the golf cart every month, from August 2019 to April 2020.
